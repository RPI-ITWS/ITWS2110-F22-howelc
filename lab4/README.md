Sorry that the styling for this lab is kind of basic. I spent a lot of time trying to get a second API to work, as
I had issues with CORS and paywalls. A majority of my time was spent dealing with these issues. I learned quite a 
bit from this lab, as I had not previously worked with APIs like this. I tinkered with the HTML5 geolocation and 
a weather map but there was no vanilla JS support, that being said I used the geolocation for the weahter API. I
tried my best to extract meaningful data from the json data and display it. The front end for this web site is
just basic bootstrap to with tabs to access each section. Overall, I wish I had more time to refine and add to
the design, although I would say I learned a lot about APIs and AJAX during this lab and therefore where I lack
in design I hope to make up for in these areas.
