For this portion of the exam I took what I made in lab 4 and added a tab
for the currency exchange. I decided to make each currency I chose have a
the same class which then I used to create an array of each currency. I then
gave each an ID to use for accessing the data from the json. I added an event
listener with a mouseover function that found the actively displayed currency.
Removed the old current from being displayed and got the new current's
id. Using that id i got the exchange rate from the data and displayed it as
in the html. I used jQuery ajax function to get the data from the API.
