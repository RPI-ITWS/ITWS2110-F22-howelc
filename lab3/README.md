This lab was rough to be honest. I got a late start on it due to other course work and I wanted to make it look very nice. 
The part that took me the longest was the homepage, as I wanted to keep the theme of the main RPI website while still having differences
that were aesthetically pleasing, accessible, and followed HCI principles. Boostrap played a huge part in the creation of the site because
I did not have enough time to create my own UI especially one that would rival boostrap's offerings. I would have liked to have more time 
on this because I felt as though on some pages I made minor changes and just copied the information. I would have prefered to add and 
change information and its formatting to a greater extent. I chose to do a multipage site to keep it closer to what an actual
ITWS site would likely resemble. My CSS has warnings but they are dynamic warnings due to using var and using browser extenstions so
please keep that in mind while grading. I did not have to write a lot of JS for this lab because of bootstrap.
I tried using SMTP js for sending the form. I got it to work then got paywalled so I could not end up using it. I left the JS i used for it commented out. Overall this lab was fun!
